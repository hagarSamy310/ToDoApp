##  Features

This to-do list application goes beyond the basics and includes several key features to provide a complete and user-friendly experience:

  * **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks with an intuitive interface.

  * **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so your to-do list is preserved even after closing the tab or reloading the page.

  * **In-Place Editing**: Seamlessly edit tasks by clicking the edit button, making changes directly in the list, and saving by pressing `Enter` or clicking away.

  * **Progress Tracking**: A dynamic progress bar and task counter (`Completed / Total`) visually represent your productivity.

  * **Motivational Feedback**: Receive encouraging messages that change based on your progress.

  * **Celebration Animation**: A fun confetti effect triggers upon completing all tasks, providing a satisfying sense of accomplishment. 

  * **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.

    * **Background Customization**: Toggle between different background images using the theme button 🎨 

  * **User-Friendly Warnings**: A non-intrusive popup message prevents users from adding or saving empty tasks.


## Technologies Used

  * **HTML5**: For the `semantic` structure and content of the application.

  * **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and animations.
      * **Flexbox**: For creating a flexible and responsive layout.
      * **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**: For maintainable and clean styling.
      * **Glassmorphism Effect**: Achieved using `backdrop-filter`.

  * **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all logic, including `DOM manipulation`, event handling, and interacting with localStorage.

  * **Font Awesome**: For clean and scalable icons.

  * **`tsparticles-confetti`**: An external library to create the celebration confetti effect.
